# ribobaser

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ribobaser is to unify common operations we use on count tables

## Installation

You can install the development version of ribobaser once you clone this repo.

``` r
devtools::install(build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

Check out the vignette for a simple example. 

```{r example}
library(ribobaser)
## basic example code
browseVignettes(package = "ribobaser")
```


You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
