\title{Replace zero counts with pseudocounts}
\usage{
zero_imputation(RIBO, RNA)
}
\arguments{
\item{RIBO}{numeric matrix or data.frame of counts with genes in rows and
samples in columns.}

\item{RNA}{numeric matrix or data.frame of counts with genes in rows and
samples in columns.}
}
\value{
list with elements
\itemize{
\item ribo: \code{RIBO} converted to a matrix with zeros replaced by ones.
\item rna:  \code{RNA} converted to a matrix with zeros replaced by ones.
}
}
\description{
Many compositional workflows require strictly positive counts before
applying log-ratio transforms. This utility performs a simple zero-imputation
step, replacing all zeros in paired RIBO and RNA matrices with ones.

\details{
Features to implement
a) Multiplicative imputation as in Shilpa's work

\examples{
RIBO <- matrix(c(0, 5, 10,
                 3, 0,  7),
               nrow = 2,
               dimnames = list(c("g1", "g2"), paste0("s", 1:3)))
RNA  <- matrix(c(2, 0, 4,
                 0, 6, 8),
               nrow = 2,
               dimnames = list(c("g1", "g2"), paste0("s", 1:3)))

zero_imputation(RIBO, RNA)
